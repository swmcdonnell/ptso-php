<!-- This is the HTML that displays as the instructions for the SPOT test. -->
<p>This is a test of your ability to imagine different perspectives
    or orientations in space. On each of the following screens you will
    see a picture of an array of objects and an "arrow circle" with a question
    about the direction between some of the objects. For the question on
    each screen, you should imagine that you are standing at one object in
    the array (which will be named in the center of the circle) and facing
    another object, named at the top of the circle. Your task is to draw an
    arrow from the center object showing the direction to a third object
    from this facing orientation.</p>
<p>There are 12 items in this test, one on each screen. For each item, the array
    of objects is shown at the top of the window and the arrow circle is shown at
    the bottom. Please do not pick up or turn the monitor. Try to mark the correct
    directions, but do not spend too much time on any one question.</p>
<p><strong>You will have 5 minutes for this test.</strong></p>
